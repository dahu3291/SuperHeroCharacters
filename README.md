# SuperHeroCharacters
Udacity Nanodegree Capstone project

This app uses the Marvel API to get information on Marvel superheros and chat with other users on the content.
You will need to get a api key from developer.marvel.com and add it to your strings.xml file like this:

 < string name="public_apikey">YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_GOES_HERE< /string>, 
 < string name="private_apikey">YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_GOES_HERE< /string>
 
 The app also requires Firebase for it's chating feature. So add the project to your Firebase console and add the google-serices.json to the app
